Why Python?
Python is one of the most used programming languages due to its simplified syntax and shallow learning curve. On top of this, it is highly used in data science and academia world (particularly on finance, economics or business related degrees). This is very important, as it is the first time in history that users - regardless of their background - can so easily add features to an investment research platform.

Why Open Source?
An open source product allows for higher quality, lower costs, more transparency, and faster go-to-market due to the strong community created. There is no point in re-inventing the wheel for financial theory that has been around for decades, thus users can adapt the platform to their needs or even build proprietary features on top of our infrastructure.

Why Free?
We believe that everyone should be able to have the same tooling to do investment research. By leveraging free API tiers, we can allow users to have access to a vast range of information for free. On the other hand, we want users that are willing to subscribe to premium API keys from certain data providers to be able to take advantage of that on OpenBB Terminal - this is where we see a monetization opportunity, a revenue share with data providers for connecting our users to their resources.

Importing and Exporting data
The terminal allows for users to import their own proprietary datasets to use on our econometrics menu. In addition, users are allowed to export any type of data to any type of format whether that is raw data in Excel or an image in PNG. This is also ideal for finance content creation.

OpenBB SDK and Customizable notebook reports
Use our OpenBB Terminal environment to access raw data through a Jupyter Notebook and play with it accordingly. Or just create customizable notebook reports for your colleagues and friends doing research on a particular asset or a macroeconomic event impact on said asset. The possibilities are endless.

Advanced user and routines
Navigate through 750+ terminal features using fast shortcuts and leverage auto-complete functionality. Jump from looking into your portfolio to comparing the financials of those companies in a few seconds. Leverage our routines implementation to run analysis while you drink your coffee or tea.

Accessing the OpenBB Terminal
The OpenBB Terminal can be directly installed on your computer via our installation program. Within this section, you are guided through the installation process and how to launch the program. If you are a developer, please have a look here. If you struggle with the installation process, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach us on Discord or visit our contact page.
