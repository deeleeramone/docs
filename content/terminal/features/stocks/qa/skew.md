## skew

### Description: 

Skewness is a measure of asymmetry or distortion of symmetric distribution. It measures the deviation of the given distribution of a random variable from a symmetric distribution, such as normal distribution. A normal distribution is without any skewness, as it is symmetrical on both sides. Hence, a curve is regarded as skewed if it is shifted towards the right or the left.

### Usage: 
```python
usage: skew [-w N_WINDOW]
```

## Parameters

| Name | Description | Default | Optional | Choices |
