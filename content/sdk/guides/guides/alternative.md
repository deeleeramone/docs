Investors utilize alternative data to analyze a company or investment that is not available through typical data sources (financial statements, SEC filings, management presentations, press releases, etc.). Traditional data sources do not provide investors with as accurate, timely, or granular insights and measurements into corporate performance as alternative data does. Increases in computing power and personal device usage have resulted in tremendous data production during the previous ten years. As a result, a slew of new businesses have sprung up to collect, clean, analyze, and interpret data in order to sell it as a product that might help investors make better decisions.
